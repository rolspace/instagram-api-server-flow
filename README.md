## Instagram Server-Side Flow

This is a demo project to illustrate how to authenticate a client with the Instagram API using the server-side flow (https://www.instagram.com/developer/authentication/).

In order to try it out, just follow these steps:

1. Register a new Instagram client at https://www.instagram.com/developer/clients/manage/

  Make sure to create a Redirect URI that will match your local Express configuration

2. Clone this repo
3. Run npm install
4. Setup the environment variables

  The environment variables needed to run the application are the following:

  - INSTAGRAM_CLIENTID: Client ID assigned after creating the Instagram client
  - INSTAGRAM_SECRET: Secret string assigned after creating the Instagram client
  - PORT: port for the Express server (default: 4000)
  - REDIRECT_URI: URI that Instagram will use to redirect to, after the user has authorized the application. You will define this URI redirect when you create the Instagram client (default: http://localhost:4000/profile.html)

5. Open a Terminal at the root of the repository's folder and run npm start
6. Browse to http://localhost:4000/
